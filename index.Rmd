## Neuroscience, Haptics, and more 

My current research interests include haptics, multisensory integration, tactile and visual perception of motion, and motor control of the hand. I have an excellent knowledge of statistical inference, expert in Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Models. In collaboration with P. Balestrucci, I am the developer and maintainer of the R package MixedPsy for the estimate of psychophysical parameters in mixed model framework.
