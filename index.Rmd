## Neuroscience Haptics and more {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

My current research interests include haptics, multisensory integration, tactile and visual perception of motion, and motor control of the hand. I have an excellent knowledge of statistical inference, expert in Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Models. Associate Editor for [IEEE Transaction on Haptics](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/editorial-board) and for [Frontiers in Physiology - Integrative Physiology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/editors). 

In collaboration with Priscilla Balestrucci, developer and maintainer of the R package [MixedPsy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MixedPsy/index.html): tools for the analysis of psychophysical data in R.
