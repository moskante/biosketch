## Neuroscience, Haptics, and more 

My current research interests include haptic, the integration of proprioception and touch, tactile and visual perception of motion, and motor control of the hand. I have an excellent knowledge of statistical inference, expert in Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Models. In collaboration with P. Balestrucci, I am the developer and maintainer of the R package MixedPsy for the estimate of psychophysical parameters in mixed model framework. I published more than 35 peer-reviewed papers in top neuroscience journals including Current Biology, Science Advances, Journal of Vision, Journal of Neurophysiology, etc.
